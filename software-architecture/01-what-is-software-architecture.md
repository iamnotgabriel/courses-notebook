# What is software architecture?

Architecture is the arrangement of objects, it is restricted to law of physics
and the reality. Software Architecture does not organize physical object 
neither follows the laws of our reality, this type of architecture organizes 
thoughts in a orderly manner and imposes restriction to achieve organizations
and avoid chaos.

# What is a good software architecture?

The consequence of not adopting an architecture is chaos from the excess of
liberty. The software becomes like a dream, it has no beginning nor end, it
does not have a shape or even a clear meaning.
Software architecture should help develops to build a simpler software with
structure and clear meaning reducing complexity.

# What is complexity?

Complexity makes it hard to understand and modify the system. To reduce 
complexity we need a architecture that makes modification and comprehension
easier.

# The SoC Principle

Given the problem, we can search for patterns and design principles to help.
There are many principles in the current software architecture literature, but
most prominent is 'Separation of Concerns'. 

## Separation of Concerns

When a problem is too large to easily solve we generally divide it into smaller
pieces. In a big problem not everything is closely related, diving the problem
makes it easier to understand what is closer and what is far away.    

Other principles tells you how to separate related ideas, but SoC is king of 
principle because it comes before all the other.
